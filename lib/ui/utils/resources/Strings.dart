My technology interest has driven me towards Mobile Development and I have been learning with Flutter for the past year now. I am also pursuing a professional basketball career at the moment, attempting to get my first contract with a team in Europe for the upcoming season. ";

  static const personalPhysicalActivity =
      "Human evolutionary science shows we evolved as persistence hunters. Meaning, it is in our DNA to be physically active on a regular basis. Everyone will have their own level of activity they are comfortable with - and that is perfectly fine - but it is my belief every able bodied person should find some level above zero. Personally (because this is a personal website) I want to push my body to its limit while I still can. There is a short window of time in every human life in which incredible feats of strength, power, quickness, agility and balance are possible. Remaining physically active as often as possible is the best way to prolong one's window. Another reason I am so passionate about physical activity is: I love to do activities with friends. It's truly my favorite pastime. Few stronger bonds can be formed between humans than through shared physical exertion. Mountain Biking, trail running, hiking, kayaking, snowboarding, golf, disc golf beach volleyball and basketball are some of my favorites. The more I'm outside, the more I'm able to play basketball, the more I'm able to run trails with my dog Vinka, the happier I am.  In addition to my recreational interest in physical activity I am also pursuing a professional athletic career via basketball. I have been playing basketball my entire life and was even able to receive a free college degree because of basketball. Now, I am attempting to get a contract with any team in Europe or Asia for the upcoming season.  I was able to win a Dunk Contest in Valencia, Spain so hopefully that's an indicator I'm off to a good start.";
