Everyone will have their own level of activity they are comfortable with - and that is perfectly fine - but it is my belief every able bodied person should find some level above zero. Personally (because this is a personal website) I want to push my body to its limit while I still can. There is a short window of time in every human life in which incredible feats of strength, power, quickness, agility and balance are possible. Remaining physically active as often as possible is the best way to prolong one's window. Another reason I am so passionate about physical activity is: I love to do activities with friends. It's truly my favorite pastime. Few stronger bonds can be formed between humans than through shared physical exertion. Mountain Biking, trail running, hiking, kayaking, snowboarding, golf, disc golf beach volleyball and basketball are some of my favorites. The more I'm outside, the more I'm able to play basketball, the more I'm able to run trails with my dog Vinka, the happier I am.";
